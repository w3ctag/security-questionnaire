This repository contains the [Editor's Draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/) of the [Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/) document, which spec authors can use to identify and work through possible security and privacy concerns related to their spec.

The questionnaire is a joint product of the [TAG](https://tag.w3.org/) and [PING](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/).

When folks request a [design review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews) from the TAG, [filling out](questionnaire.markdown) the security and privacy questionnaire helps everyone to understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for the design, and can save us asking redundant questions.
