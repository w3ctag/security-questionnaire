This repository contains the [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/security-questionnaire/) of the [Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/) document, which spec authors can use to identify and work through possible security and privacy concerns related to their spec.

The questionnaire is a joint product of three groups: the [TAG](https://tag.w3.org/), [PING](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/), and the [Security Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/security/).

When folks request a [design review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews) from the TAG, [filling out](questionnaire.markdown) the security and privacy questionnaire helps the TAG to understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for the design, and can save us asking redundant questions.

Before requesting security and
privacy review
from the Security Interest Group and PING, respectively, documents must
contain both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations"
sections for their documents, as described in Section 2.15.  While
your answers to the questions in this document will inform your
writing of those sections, it is not appropriate to merely copy this
questionnaire into those sections.

[Further instructions on requesting security and privacy reviews can be found in the Guide.](https://w3c.github.io/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review)
